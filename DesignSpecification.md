Technology is advancing and becoming faster causing our lives move quicker. Many of our co-workers wake up in time to run out the door and rush off to work get a thirty-minute break for lunch and scramble to complete daily tasks before quitting time. Then rush off to family events and appointments only to arrive at home just in time for bed. The increasing speed of society doesnâ€™t leave much time for many people to do those tedious or time-consuming activities that use to be easily integrated into our day.

We also are seeing an increase in life expectancy along with the world becoming a smaller place and families being more separated than ever before. These individuals are left at the availability of those around them to bring them the items they need or want in a time frame that suits them.
